he current marketing campaign depends on repeated phone calls to secure product subscriptions. To improve efficiency and reduce costs, it is recommended that the bank first identify clients with the highest probability of subscribing to a term deposit. By prioritizing these clients for outreach, the campaign can minimize unnecessary calls, optimize resource allocation, and achieve better conversion rates.

# Prerequisites
To run the code, the following packages must be installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib and seaborn
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- xgboost


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- The age distribution of clients highlighted that the majority fell in the 30-40 age range, coinciding with the highest subscription rate for term deposits.
- Occupation-wise, clients in administrative, blue-collar and management roles formed the majority and were more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
- Marital status leaned heavily toward the "married" category.
- Clients with university degrees or high-level education were more prominent and had a higher subscription rate.
- Credit defaults were rare, with the vast majority of clients having no credit defaults.
- Clients with housing loans are slightly more likely to subscribe to term deposits, while those with personal loans were less likely.
